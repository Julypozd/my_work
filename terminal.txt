/ - The root directory or a separator when listing directories
. - The current directory (also ./) or the same level
.. - The directory one level up (also ../)
../.. - Two levels up
~ - Your "home" directory, or the directory you are placed in when you log in.
* - The "splat" or "glob" operator. This is the wildcard of the command line and represents "any characters."

Command	What it does
cp	Copy one or more files to a new location
mv	Move or rename a file or directory
mkdir	Make a new directory
touch	Create a new file or update modification time if a file with that name exists
rm	Remove one or more files or directories

You can list all files, including hidden ones, in a directory using the -a flag.
ls -a

To only list hidden (also called dotfiles) files, you can use the following command:
ls -d 

ls .. (list parent directory)

mv * ~/tmp скопировать все в tmp directory

mv test Desktop/tmp

Using the glob operator *, (also known as the wildcard or just asterisk) you can move all files that match a particular pattern.
ls abc/*.txt

You can also pass the $HOME variable as an argument, or use the ~ (tilde) as the first argument to achieve the same results:

Use the -lah set of flags as arguments to the ls command to get more detailed information about files and directories:
ls -lah

To figure out a default executable's location, you can use the which command:
$ which touch

$ SOMETHING='some value'
$ echo $SOMETHING

PS1="(testprompt)> "
(testprompt)>

\h	Hostname
\u	User name
\w	Current directory
\W	Basename of current directory
\d	Current date
\n	Newline

echo $PATH
